# Sample data Files
In this folder we keep a couple of data files that we can use for testing certain features of the 
analyzer tool.

* eventlog-simple: Fairly small eventlog file, useful for initial development and testing loading of data.
* eventlog-overpartitioned: Large file containing failed tasks and stages, and showing evidence of 
  over partitioning (too many tasks that are too small).
